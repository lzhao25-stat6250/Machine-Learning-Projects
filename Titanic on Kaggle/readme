Title: Who Would Survive the Titanic Diaster ?
Author: Lanqin  Zhao, Lanqin Zhao

This project is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

“The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic
sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international 
community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there
were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some 
groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply
the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy."
